# Atomic Arch Auditor

A minimal, performance-focused, zero-dependency Python utility designed to scan Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions (like EndeavourOS) for indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the **Atomic Arch** supply chain campaign. 

It queries threat intelligence feeds from **Sonatype** and **SafeDep** to identify compromised AUR installations, hijacked packages, and eBPF kernel rootkits.

## Features
- **Zero External Dependencies:** Built strictly on native Python 3 libraries (`urllib`, `json`, `subprocess`) to ensure safe execution on potentially compromised environments.
- **Dynamic Threat Intel:** Fetches live blocklists and known artifact patterns directly from Sonatype and SafeDep.
- **System Artifact Verification:** Sweeps package manager caches (`~/.npm`, `~/.bun`) and kernel footprints for the `scales.bpf` rootkit.
- **Blast Radius Analysis:** Evaluates dependency mapping via `pacman -Qi` before removing packages to prevent accidental system breakage.

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repository and execute the script directly. It requires no environment setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PicasoTheDeal/AUR-threat-mitigator.git
cd AUR-threat-mitigator
chmod +x aur-api-audit.py
python3 aur-api-audit.py
```
